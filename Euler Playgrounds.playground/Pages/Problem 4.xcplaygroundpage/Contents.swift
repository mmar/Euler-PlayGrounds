//: ## Problem 4 - Largest palindrome product
//: A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
//:
//: Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

//: ### The brute force approach
//: Get all possible products, check which ones are palindromes and then pick the largest.
